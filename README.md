# Week1
AICTE Internship Cycle 2

The EV Adoption Forecasting Week1.ipynb notebook contains the initial phase of the EV forecasting project, focusing on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and understanding regional EV registration trends across Washington State. Key activities in this notebook include:

Importing and preprocessing monthly vehicle registration data (2017â€“2024).

Analyzing the growth trend of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).

Visualizing EV adoption across counties and over time.

Calculating percentage share of EVs compared to total vehicle registrations.

Laying the foundation for predictive modeling in subsequent phases.

This notebook sets the stage for building a robust forecasting model that can help urban planners and decision-makers understand and anticipate future EV infrastructure needs.
